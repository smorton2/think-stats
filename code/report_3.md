# Television Viewership and Society

Nowadays, nearly every home has a television. According to Nielsen, 118 million households have televisions, and the average American watches 3 hours of TV each day. People use TV to follow the news, learn about politics, and for entertainment. In this study, I found that there are some interesting correllations between TV use and other parts of peoples' lives. For example, people who have completed a form of higher education watch 2 hours of TV less than people who haven't completed a form of higher education. People with lower income tend to watch more tv than people with higher incomes too.

I first looked at the survey I was using. I used the General Social Survey, a survey from Chicago, that inteerviewd 1887 people on numerous different social questions ranging from drug use to approval of capital punishment for different situations. I focused on the number of hours the average respondent spent watching television, and then compared this information to some interesting variables I found to see whether or not there were any trends that influenced the number of hours someone spent watching TV.

I first started by making a CDF of the time spent watching tv by all respondents, as seen in figure 1.
