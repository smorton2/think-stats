Report 2 review
This report used the Global Terrorism Database to explore the nature of terrorist attacks, and ultimately determine the factors that make countries targets for terrorist attacks. The author uses fitted scatter plots to demonstrate the frequency and deadliness of terrorist attacks, and asserts that although attacks are getting slightly deadlier, the increasing quantity of attacks leads to many more deaths per year due to terrorist attacks. The author then explores the question “what makes a good target for terrorism?” and uses the Penn World Table 9.0 to supplement the Global Terrorism Database with country information. He finds that most terrorist attacks are local, and “the juiciest targets for terrorists are in their own backyard and their neighbors.” 
	The author answers his question by saying that there are so few international terrorist attacks that it’s only practical to focus on domestic attacks. This report does a good job maintaining clarity, especially with the graphs. The final graph is missing context and labels, so it’s pretty difficult to understand. The rest of the analysis is very good, and the author did a great job with the limited data. There were a couple spelling errors, but besides that the presentation was very good.
