## Television and Life

Paul Krusell

Nowadays, nearly every home has a television. According to Nielsen, 118 million households have televisions, and the average American watches 3 hours of TV each day. People use TV to follow the news, learn about politics, and for entertainment. In this study, I found that there are some interesting correllations between TV use and other parts of peoples' lives. For example, people who have completed a form of higher education watch 2 hours of TV less than people who haven't completed a form of higher education. People with lower income tend to watch more tv than people with higher incomes too.
